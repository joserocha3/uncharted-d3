# uncharted-d3

Web application using Meteor and D3. UI is done in React. All visualizations are made from scratch using D3, no prepackaged libraries were used. 

The main route and linked route are public facing, there is an admin console to modify the data seen on the public facing routes.

Started out as an application for a client, but contract fell through ðŸ˜ª. So instead I would like to share this knowledge with anyone that would like to take a look :bowtie:.
